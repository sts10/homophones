# Homophones

A Rust tool that makes a list of homophones from [Wikitionary](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wiktionary:Main_Page).

## What's in this project

If you're looking for lists of homophones, look in the `homophone-lists` directory.

Lists that are labeled "as pairs" contain pairs of homophones separated by commas. Example: 

```txt
acts,ax
adds,ads
adds,adze
```

Lists labeled "as singles" are these same words, but with each on its own line, no commas: 

```txt
acts
ax
adds
ads
adds
adze
```

Any lists with "cleaned" in the file name have been cleaned in some way, likely trimmed of whitespace, de-duplicated, and sorted alphabetically. I'd recommend using cleaned files over singles.

## Making your own list of homophones

If you wish, you can edit the `input_list.txt` file and then run the scraping Rust script again by running `cargo run --release` (Rust will need to be installed). The script will search Wikitionary for each word in the input_list file, searching for homophones. 

By default, it will write the file as homophone pairs, separated by commas (see above).
