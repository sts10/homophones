# Homophones

A Rust command-line tool that makes a list of homophones from [Wikitionary](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wiktionary:Main_Page).

## What's in this project

- Some lists of homophones
- A Rust command-line tool to generate your own list of homophones, based on an inputted word list. 

## Lists of homophones

If you're looking for lists of homophones, look in the `homophone-lists` directory.

Lists that are labeled "as pairs" contain pairs of homophones separated by commas. Example: 

```txt
acts,ax
adds,ads
adds,adze
```

Lists labeled "as singles" are these same words, but with each on its own line, no commas: 

```txt
acts
ax
adds
ads
adds
adze
```

Any lists with "cleaned" in the file name have been cleaned in some way, likely trimmed of whitespace, de-duplicated, and sorted alphabetically. I'd recommend using cleaned files.

## Making your own list of homophones

To make your own list of homophones, you'll want to use the included command-line tool. 

### How it works

The command-line tool will search and scrape Wikitionary for each word in the inputted word list file(s), searching for homophones. 

### Installing the command-line tool

1. [Install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) if you haven't already
2. Run: `cargo install --git https://github.com/sts10/homophones --branch main`

### Usage 

```txt
Usage: homophones [OPTIONS] <Inputted word lists>...

Arguments:
  <Inputted word lists>...  Word list input files. Can provide more than one (they'll be combined)

Options:
  -p, --pairs <PAIRS_OUTPUT>      Path for outputted file for list of PAIRS of homophones
  -s, --singles <SINGLES_OUTPUT>  Path for outputted file for list of SINGLE homophones
  -f, --force                     Force overwrite of output file(s), if it exists
  -h, --help                      Print help
  -V, --version                   Print version
```

### Examples

Take words from a file called `input_list.txt` and print a list of homophones, one per line, to a new file called `some_homophones_as_a_single_list.txt`:
`homophones -s some_homophones_as_a_single_list.txt input_list.txt` 

Take words from a file called `input_list.txt` and print a list of homophones, a pair of homophones per line, to a new file called `some_homophones_as_pairs_list.txt`:
`homophones -p some_homophones_as_pairs_list.txt input_list.txt`

Do both of those things at once!
`homophones -s some_homophones_as_a_single_list.txt -p some_homophones_as_pairs_list.txt input_list.txt`
